###Style Guide

**Principles**
The aim to make the aesthetic of the site simple, clean, and timeless. 

**Values**  
RC3 is about a community learning together.  
Express that

**Logo**
The logo must stay consistent. The same w-h ratio, the same colors.
There are two variations of the logo, colored and all white.  

**Colors**  
The primary colors have been picked out by our sponsor QoCreate;
f36e21 - orange
555555 - grey
black, white

RC3 Orange should only sit on white, but it can also act as a background image with white text on top.
Images may lie on a RC3 Orange background if the image has been grayed out, to match the consistency of the logo.

RC3 Grey should be used minimally, saved for footers and links.

Black should always be used for body text.

**Typography**  
The focus of the site is simplicity so let's use system fonts. One less HTTP GET, woot.


**Copy**
Content is king. Copy is how you express a brand message.  
Copy should stay consistent in writing style and principles. The language should be clear and direct, if not also exciting.

**Aesthetic**
Sharp and flat  
No round corners  
No drop shadows
